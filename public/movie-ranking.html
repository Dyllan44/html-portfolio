<h1>Dyllan's Favorite movies</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Movies for me</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Iron Man</h3>
<p>This movie was the start of something amazing in the marvel movie universe</p>
<br />
<h3>Warrior</h3>
<p>This movie is so inspirational, it truly shows when you keep on fighting you will come out on top</p>
<br />
<h3>Shooter</h3>
<p>It is actually my Father's favorite, but I liked it a lot because it is somewhat realistic</p>
