<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Dyllan van Wyk.<br>
  I started with Angelas Web Development course on 12 May 2025,<br>
  so far I have found it very interesting.
</p>

<p>The reason why I wanted to start learning web development, is because I wanted to make a career shift.<br>
  I have always had an intrest in coding, I just never explored it.<br>
  I am very happy that I did start with this course.
</p>

<p>My goal at the end of the day is to be able to design awesome high end websites and work as a freelancer</p>
